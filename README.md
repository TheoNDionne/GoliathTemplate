# Codex: A minimal template for typesetting longform documents in latex

## Description

This repository contains a latex template is meant for those that wish to typeset a longform document (thesis, memoir *etc*). This template takes its roots in a template produced by Prof. David Sénéchal (2013) and was more recently modified into its current form by my dear friend Jérôme Leblanc (2025).

In summary, my main contributions are:
- Improving compatibility to the more modern and powerful **LuaLaTeX**
- Main text in **EB Garamond** (beautiful and traditional open source font)
- Math in **Libertinus Math** (neutral font with good overall support)
- Personal **tweaks** and slight **clean** up of the preamble and so on

## Basic usage

Compile document using `latexmk -f -pdflua MAIN.tex`. Enjoy!
